## What is R?
![](cars.jpg){#id .class width=70% height=70%}

## What is R?
* A calculator:
```{r}
2+2
```

## What is R?
* A calculator
* A coding language:
```{r}
var <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
length(var)
```

## What is R?
* A calculator
* A coding language
* A statistics and graphical environment:
```{r, fig.height=3}
plot(var)
```

## RStudio
* Just like excel, or SPSS, or atom
* Integrated platform for writing and running R code
* Also a text editor, latex integration, version control, notebook, etc
* Has scripts (top left) and console (bottom left) - try to use scripts for saveable and reproducible code
* I even wrote this powerpoint in RStudio!!!

## Types of data
* Characters or strings
* Numbers or vectors or doubles
* Matrix or data frame
```{r}
typeof(var)
```

## Types of Data
```{r}
var <- as.character(var)
typeof(var)
var
```

## Messing with data
```{r}
var[4]
```

```{r}
y <- var[2:4]
y
```

## Packages etc
* Important thing about R is that everything can be googled
* Lots of libraries that mean you can do anything under the sun
* Most packages are on Github so you can even see how they are made!
* There are packages already for *most* things you want to do

## Some Rules
* Data needs to be *tidy*. This means:
    - Each row is an *observation*
    - Each variable is a *column*
    - Data should be in a *single dataset*

## How to R
* We assign variables with <- (or =)...
```{r}
x <- 5
x
x < 2
x == 5
```

## How to R
```{r}
y <- 1:10
y/x
y*x
y^x
#comments
```

## Messy Data
```{r, echo = T}
level <- c('Undergrad', 'Graduate')
males <- c(7,2)
females <- c(1,5)
lab <- data.frame(level,males,females)
```

## Messy data

```{r, echo =F}
library(knitr)
kable(lab, caption = 'Lab Members')
```

* How many variables do we actually have here???

## Tidy data
```{r, echo = T, message=F}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
lab2 <- pivot_longer(lab, 
                     cols = c(males, females), 
                     names_to = 'gender', 
                     values_to = 'number')
```


## Tidy data
```{r, echo = F}
kable(lab2, caption = 'Lab Members')
```


## Tidy data
```{r, echo = F}
kable(lab2, caption = 'Lab Members')
```

* Always aim for this - most R functions require it!

## Putting it back
* Sometime we do want a wide format for our own summaries etc
* Can still use pivot
```{r}
lab_short <- pivot_wider(lab2, 
                         names_from = gender, 
                         values_from = number)
```

## Let's look
```{r, echo = F}
kable(lab_short, caption = 'Lab Members')
```

## Chocolate survey
* Time for some "real" data
* I took a survey of prop of people in each research group who like each chocolate
* We need to open the file and get it out and take a look

## Chocolate survey
```{r}
choc <- read_csv('choccies.csv')
```

```{r, eval = F}
View(choc)
```

```{r, echo = F}
kable(choc)
```

## What can we do with this?
```{r}
summary(choc)
```

## What can we do with this?
* What if we are only interested in 2 choccies?
```{r}
ctwo <- select(choc, boost, bounty)
```


```{r, echo = F}
kable(ctwo)
```

## What can we do with this?
* Whooops! We left out our groups variable!
* We can indicate a range with :
```{r}
ctwo <- select(choc, Group:bounty)
```


```{r, echo = F}
kable(ctwo)
```

## What can we do with this?
* Suppose we only want some rows
* Perhaps we (me) hypothesize that the only groups worth considering are those that rate Boost bars
```{r}
cfil <- filter(choc, boost >= .5)
```

```{r, echo = F}
kable(cfil)
```

## What (else) can we do with this?
* OK, but maybe we don;t want to base everything on one type of choccy
* So we need to arrange it to see views all different choccies, arranged by boost
```{r}
carr <- arrange(choc, desc(boost))
```

```{r, echo = F}
kable(carr)
```

## Adding columns
* Lion is pretty important to us as well
* We need to add a column that will give us a better understanding
```{r}
cmut <- mutate(choc, 
               weighting = (boost + lion)/2)
cmut <- arrange(cmut, desc(boost))
```

```{r, echo = F}
kable(cmut)
```

## Piping
* What we just did works, but isn't very elegant...
* Rather than going step by step, it's better to put it all together
* The operator %>% does this
* Any function with a f(x,y) argument can be written x %>% f(y)

## Piping
```{r}
cmut <- choc %>%
  mutate(weighting = (boost + lion)/2) %>%
  arrange(desc(boost))
```

```{r, echo = F}
kable(cmut)
```

## A note
* It's important to remember that in R, there are many ways of doing things
* These functions are the most user-friendly for this, but there are other options!
* Our filtered argument above could instead be written:
```{r, eval = F}
cfil <- choc[choc$boost >= 0.5]
```
* Play with some of the options!

## Back to choccies
* So we can do cool stuff with the choccies data, but it's not *tidy*
* What should it look like?
* Can you make it look like that???
